- Unit tests for all ViewModels, UseCases, and Repositories (60 tests)
- SwiftLint integration via SPM
- Dark Mode support with semantic colors
- ChatGPT-inspired visual redesign: assistant messages with sparkles avatar, user messages with glass accent bubbles, empty state with centered icon and suggestion chips
- ConversationStartersManager with 8 suggestion prompts, randomly showing 4 per session
- "Thinking..." indicator with pulse animation below assistant messages while waiting for first token
- Streaming cursor (█) inline at the end of the last text block during response generation
- Glass effect input bar with capsule shape and animated send/stop buttons
- Chat visual style instruction document for agent context
- Refactored instruction documents with generic/app-specific separation
- KeychainManager for secure storage of server URL and API key using iOS/macOS Keychain Services
- ResetAppDataUseCase to clear all persisted data (Keychain + UserDefaults) on first launch
- Automatic migration from UserDefaults to Keychain for existing users
- `deleteAll()` method on SettingsManager for full data cleanup
- Unit tests for KeychainManager and ResetAppDataUseCase
- MockKeychainManager and MockResetAppDataUseCase test doubles
- MarkdownParser utility that splits assistant message content into typed blocks (`.text`, `.codeBlock`)
- CodeBlockView with monospaced font, horizontal scroll, language label, and one-tap copy button (UIPasteboard / NSPasteboard)
- Full Markdown block rendering in assistant messages: headings (H1–H3), lists, blockquotes, bold, italic, inline code, and links via `AttributedString` with `.full` syntax
- `LLMModel.Provider` enum (`.local` / `.cloud`) with classification logic based on `litellm_provider` from `/model/info`
- Local vs Cloud sections in Models screen, each sorted alphabetically
- Dynamic model icon: `desktopcomputer` for local models, `cloud` for cloud models
- Selected model highlighted with a 1.5pt accent-color border instead of a tinted background
- Smart auto-scroll in chat: follows new content only when the user is at the bottom; pauses when user scrolls up and resumes when they reach the bottom again
- Chat message area capped at 760pt max width, centered horizontally (better iPad/Mac layout)

### Changed

- Settings screen: merged Connection and Save sections into a single Server section for a cleaner layout
- SettingsManager now delegates server URL and API key storage to KeychainManager instead of UserDefaults
- LaunchViewModel resets all app data when onboarding has not been completed (first launch / reinstall)
- `FetchModelsUseCase` now propagates `provider` from `/model/info`, with `owned_by` as fallback
- `ModelsRepository.fetchModelInfo()` maps `litellm_provider` to `LLMModel.Provider`
- `LazyVStack` in chat uses `.padding(.horizontal, 16)` only (removed unneeded vertical padding)
- Assistant message spacing increased to 8pt between blocks for readability

### Fixed

- Chat screen turning black during streaming due to cascading `.smooth` animations on every token; token updates now use no animation, only message count changes animate
- Message entry transition simplified to `.opacity` to prevent layout thrashing during streaming
- Keyboard opening on top of chat messages without scrolling to the last message

### Security

- Server URL and API key are no longer stored in plain text in UserDefaults
- Keychain items use `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock` protection level
